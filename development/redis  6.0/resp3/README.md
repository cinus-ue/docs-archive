This is the repository for the version 3 of the RESP protocol.
RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) is the protocol used in the [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis) database, however the protocol is designed to be used by other projects. With the version 3 of the protocol, currently a work in progress design, the protocol aims to become even more generally useful to other systems that want to implement a protocol which is simple, efficient, and with a very large landscape of client libraries implementations.

Here you can find the [current RESP3 specification](spec.md).

In the future this repository may add additional resources, such as example implementations of RESP or other resources.
